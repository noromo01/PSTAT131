This project is separated into four folders. The image folder has images that were put in the markdown text. The modelRuns folder has all the models that were run and saved throughout the code. The rawData folder has all of the raw data for this project. Note that the bikingDF and bikingClass have all of the data after it had been merged. The rest of the spreadsheets are pre-merged data. The rmdsAndHtmls folder has all of the rmds and htmls that were compiled in this code. Note that each component of the code was broken down into a more consumable chunk but all the code is in one place in the cyclingMachineLearning code. The codebook has information on all variables used in this project. The rmds are intended to be consumed in the following order: introduction -> dataCleaning -> EDA -> classModels -> regModels -> results -> sources
